##### Resale Demand/Certificates

1. Go to [CondoCerts](https://www.condocerts.com) and create an account (if you don't have one already).
2. Search for the Klahanie Association
3. Order the Full Resale Demand Package
4. Provide all the requested information.
5. Submit

Once submitted, the Association will receive email notification and, in turn, will go in and approve the Resale Demand Request. Approval usually takes within 12 to 24 hours of submittal.

Once approved the requester will receive email notification of the approval. At that point, the requester can log into condocerts.com and retrieve all the requested information.

All sales/transactions that take place within Klahanie must go through this service in order to ensure proper transfer of ownership.
