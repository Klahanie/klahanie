#### Resale Demand/Certificates
Klahanie uses [CondoCerts](https://www.condocerts.com) to handle Resale Demand/Certificates. Klahanie sellers must go through CondoCerts in order to ensure proper transfer of ownership. Following the steps below, owners should order the Full Resale Demand Package before the sale closes. 

1. Register or Sign in at [CondoCerts.com](https://www.condocerts.com)
2. Search for the Klahanie Association
3. Order the Full Resale Demand Package
4. Provide the requested information
5. Submit

The KHOA receives email notification when an order is submitted and will approve the resale demand request. The requester receives email notification as soon as the request is approved and can then log into CondoCerts.com to retrieve the requested information.

#### Condominiums and Townhomes
For condos and townhomes in Klahanie, you should order two separate Resale Demands/Certificates: one for the condominum or subassociation and one for the Klahanie Association. Both of these demands must be ordered or the transfer of ownership will not take place. Contact the condo or townhome management company to find out how to order a demand. The Klahanie Homeowners Association questionnaire provides general Klahanie information and does not include property-specific information. 

Email [info@klahanie.com](mailto:info@klahanie.com) or call (425) 392-4663 with questions. Please call CondoCerts customer service at (800) 310-6552 with specific questions about the CondoCerts website or your order.

#### Assessments 
Owners of all Klahanie homes, condos, and townhomes need to pay quarterly dues to the Klahanie Association. Currently, the assessments for each household are $800/year. These due are paid in $200 quarterly installments, on the first of January, April, July, and October. For more information regarding quarterly payments, visit our [Assessment and Collection Policy]({{site.url}}/files/assessment_payment_and_collection_policy.pdf) page, or contact the Klahanie office at [info@klahanie.com](mailto:info@klahanie.com) or (425) 392-4663.

Owners belonging to a condo or townhome subassociation pay two separate assessments. Subassociation dues should be paid directly to the subassociation management company. Please contact your subassociation for more information.
