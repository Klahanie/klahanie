description: Ashley Park contains 58 single family homes. This neighborhood is near the Winslow Place Park, which has a play structure and an open field surrounded by a green belt on three sides. There is a Native Growth Protection Area adjacent to the homes on one side of Ashley Park. All homes have convenient access to a paved trail that runs along the protected area.
