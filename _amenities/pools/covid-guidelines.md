## Open Swim Guidelines

We’ve updated our pool protocols to further comply with the government Covid-19 guidelines:
* **30-person maximum for each facility and 15-person maximum in each pool** at any given time
* **Open Swims are Now Instructional / No Fees Charged** – swimmers will be assigned in groups of 5, guards will provide basic tips for swim skill improvement as requested by swimmers
* **Online Registration Now Required for Open Instructional Swim** - [Register for a time slot](https://www.teamunify.com/SwimLessons.jsp?_tabid_=182023&team=cmkhoaa)
  * Registration opens 8pm the evening before the registered date and closes 5 minutes before the specified registration time slot (you must create a team unify account in order to register).
  * Registration is required for those who wish to swim in the pool, but not those that will remain on the deck

## Private swim lessons now being offered - Group and Individual

Please evaluate the new COVID Swim Lesson Guidelines below to determine if your child is currently eligible for lessons. If your child is eligible, please [email us](mailto:swimlessons@klahanie.com) to have them placed on the wait list.

## COVID Private Swim Lesson Guidelines

* During Phase 2 - activities that make six-foot physical distancing difficult (e.g., instructing beginner swimmers) are not authorized
* We are only offering swim lessons for children **Beginner 2 level and up**
  * **To qualify the student must be able to swim the width of the pool (approx. 15 meters) without being helped**
* Instructors will avoid direct contact with the swimmers
* Instructors will be in the water for Beginner level students, and on the deck for Intermediate and Advanced level students.
* Private and Semi-private lessons will only be offered during Open Swim times
  * Once swimmers are assigned an instructor, times will be scheduled directly with instructor (we appreciate your flexibility with scheduling)
* Semi-private lessons will only be available for members of the same household only (i.e. both swimmers must live in the same house)
  * Swimmers must have similar swimming ability as well
