During Phase 3, lap swim, open swim, swim lessons, and competition swim training are allowed with specific restrictions. Please note that the locker rooms are available for showring or changing. Spectators are now allowed on deck. Masks must be worn and capacity is limited to 1 person per 72 square feet.

Lap Swim 
* There is no maximum people per lane as long as social distancing can be mainted during rest periods. 
* Swimmers should enter from oppposite ends of the pool.

Open Swim
* Guests are not allowed.
* People from the same household can be together, but there should be adequate space to allow for physical distancing between people from different households.
* Spaces will be defined by the lifeguards, and patrons must remain within those designated spaces except when exiting the pool.
* Reservations must be made for each swimmer because we have an eight-patron limit.

Swim Lessons
* Social distancing (six feet) should be maintained as much as possible.
* Instructors must wear face shields while teaching.

Competition Swim Training
* The coach will have a diagram of safe lane configurations that demonstrates how swimmers will be able to maintain six feet of distancing, except when swimmers briefly pass      each other.
* No two swimmers shall remain within six feet of each other during resting periods. 
* Practice must be supervised by a certified coach who meets the requirement of WAC 246-260-99901.0.

## Registration Guidelines

* Registration is required for all those who wish to swim. Spectators are not allowed.
* Registration will open at 8:00 a.m. the evening before the registration date and close five minutes before the specified registration time slot.
  * No-shows - If registered swimmers do not show within five minutes of their start time, the spot will be given to the next person on the waiting list.
  * Waiting lists - Waiting lists will be maintained at each pool. Residents must be present to place their names on the lists (not done online). If we experience a no-show, or there is capacity, we will allow those on the waiting list to enter first come, first served.
  * Cancellations - If you need to cancel your reservation, please call the office at  [425.392.4663](tel:425.392.4663), or email swimlessons@klahanie.com

## Private and Semi-private Swim Lessons Are Now Being Offered

* Currently, we are only offering private and semi-private swim lessons.
* Semi-private swimmers must have similar swimming ability.
* Sign up for swimming lessons by choosing your instructor and time on the [registration website](https://www.teamunify.com/SwimLessons.jsp?_tabid_=182023&team=cmkhoaa).
* Face shields are being worn by the instrctors for activites that make six-foot physical distancing difficult (e.g., insturucting beginner swimmers).
