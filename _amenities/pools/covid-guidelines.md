### POOL UPDATE – IMPROVED PROCESS FOR REGISTRATION

Please find below clarifications and adjustments that we believe will be helpful: 
•	During Phase 2 – only “Instructional” swim is allowed (groups of 5 or less)
•	Open Swims are now called Open Instructional Swims (no fees charged)  
Swimmers will be assigned in groups of 5 (not necessary to stay in group during swim) - guards will provide basic tips for swim skill improvement as requested by swimmers.
•	Online registration is now required for Open Instructional Swim

o	Registration opens at 8 p.m. the evening before the registered date and closes 5 minutes before the specified registration time slot. (You must create a KHOA Team Unify account in order to register).
o	Registration is required for ALL those who wish to enter facility – whether swimming or not.
o	30-person maximum for each facility and pool at any given time 
(no longer 15 only in pool / 15 on deck)
o	No Shows– if registered swimmers do not show within 10 minutes of start time, their spot will be given to the next on waitlist.
o	Wait Lists - a wait list will be maintained at each pool. Residents must be present to place names on list (not done online). If we experience a no-show, or there is capacity, we will allow those on wait list to enter – first come, first serve.
o	Cancellations – if you need to cancel reservations please call office at 425.392.4663, or email swimlessons@klahanie.com
o	Questions? Call pools directly:
	Lakeside Pool        425.391.8503
	Mountain View Pool   425.557.7856


## Private swim lessons now being offered - Group and Individual

Please evaluate the new COVID Swim Lesson Guidelines below to determine if your child is currently eligible for lessons. If your child is eligible, please [email us](mailto:swimlessons@klahanie.com) to have them placed on the wait list.

## COVID Private Swim Lesson Guidelines

* During Phase 2 - activities that make six-foot physical distancing difficult (e.g., instructing beginner swimmers) are not authorized
* We are only offering swim lessons for children **Beginner 2 level and up**
  * **To qualify the student must be able to swim the width of the pool (approx. 15 meters) without being helped**
* Instructors will avoid direct contact with the swimmers
* Instructors will be in the water for Beginner level students, and on the deck for Intermediate and Advanced level students.
* Private and Semi-private lessons will only be offered during Open Swim times
  * Once swimmers are assigned an instructor, times will be scheduled directly with instructor (we appreciate your flexibility with scheduling)
* Semi-private lessons will only be available for members of the same household only (i.e. both swimmers must live in the same house)
  * Swimmers must have similar swimming ability as well

If you have any questions, contact the [Association](mailto:info@klahanie.com) or call [425-392-4663](tel:425-392-4663)
