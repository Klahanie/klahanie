### COVID-19 SWIM GUIDELINES

During Phase 2, lap swim, open swim, swim lessons, and competition swim training are allowed with specific restrictions. Please note that the locker rooms are not available for showering or changing. The locker rooms will remain locked except when a restroom is needed.

Lap Swim 
* There is a maximum of two people per lane.
* Swimmers will enter from opposite ends of the pool.
* No two swimmers shall remain within six feet of each other during resting periods.

Open Swim
* Guests are not allowed.
* People from the same household can be together, but there should be adequate space to allow for physical distancing between people from different households.
* Spaces will be defined by the lifeguards, and patrons must remain within those designated spaces except when exiting the pool.
* Reservations must be made for each swimmer because we have an eight-patron limit.

Swim Lessons
* Social distancing (six feet) must be maintained as much as possible.
* Limit the time providing close-contact instruction (closer than six feet) to a maximum of five minutes per student in each swim lesson session.
* Groups can only have up to five swimmers.

Competition Swim Training
* There is a maximum of four people per lane.
* The coach will have a diagram of safe lane configurations that demonstrates how swimmers will be able to maintain six feet of distancing, except when swimmers briefly pass      each other.
* No two swimmers shall remain within six feet of each other during resting periods. 
* Practice must be supervised by a certified coach who meets the requirement of WAC 246-260-99901.0.

## Registration Guidelines

* Registration is required for all those who wish to swim. Spectators are not allowed.
* Registration will open at 8:00 a.m. the evening before the registration date and close five minutes before the specified registration time slot.
  * No-shows - If registered swimmers do not show within five minutes of their start time, the spot will be given to the next person on the waiting list.
  * Waiting lists - Waiting lists will be maintained at each pool. Residents must be present to place their names on the lists (not done online). If we experience a no-show, or there is capacity, we will allow those on the waiting list to enter first come, first served.
  * Cancellations - If you need to cancel your reservation, please call the office at  [425.392.4663](tel:425.392.4663), or email swimlessons@klahanie.com
  * Register to swim here. 

## Private and Semi-private Swim Lessons Are Now Being Offered

* Currently, we are only offering private and semi-private swim lessons.
* To participate in private and semi-private lessons, the student must be able to swim the width of the pool (approx. 15 meters) without assistance.
* Instructors will be on deck and will not be in direct contact with the swimmers.
* Once swimmers are assigned an instructor, times will be scheduled directly with the instructor. (We appreciate your flexibility with scheduling.)
* Semi-private lessons will only be available for members of the same household. (Both swimmers must live in the same house.)
* Semi-private swimmers must have similar swimming ability.
* Sign up for swimming lessons by sending an email to swimlessons@klahanie.com.
* Activities that make six-foot physical distancing difficult (e.g., instructing beginner swimmers) are not being offered at this time.
