### Private &amp; Semiprivate lessons. 

Private and semiprivate lessons are offered year-round, based on instructor availability. The instructor availability and class times are on our [Team Unify Page](https://www.teamunify.com/SwimLessons.jsp?_tabid_=182023&team=cmkhoaa).

If you need to cancel a private or semiprivate lesson, you must notify the instructor at least 24 hours in advance. Otherwise, we cannot reschedule the lesson. Please note that when lessons are booked, your instructor is counting on you to attend your lessons. 

### Summer group lessons

Klahanie offers group lessons for all ages. Visit [Klahanie HOA Aquatics](https://www.teamunify.com/SubTabGeneric.jsp?team=cmkhoaa&_stabid_=167646) to learn more about available group swim lessons.

Please call the Klahanie Association office at (425) 463-6388 if you have any questions.
