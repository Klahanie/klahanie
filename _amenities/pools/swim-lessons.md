### Private &amp; Semiprivate lessons. 

Private and semiprivate lessons are offered year-round, based on instructor availability. The instructor availability and class times are on our [Team Unify Page](https://www.teamunify.com/SwimLessons.jsp?_tabid_=182023&team=cmkhoaa).
Contact the [Swim Lesson Coordinator](mailto:swimlessons@klahanie.com) to start the registration process. After contacting the Swim Lesson Coordinator, you will receive a unique registration link and will be connected with an instructor to schedule lessons. Please do not try to register for private/semiprivate lessons on your own.

If you need to cancel a private or semiprivate lesson, you must notify the instructor at least 24 hours in advance. Otherwise, we cannot reschedule the lesson. Please note that when lessons are booked, your instructor is counting on you to attend your lessons. They get paid for teaching the lesson. 

### Summer group lessons

Klahanie offers group lessons for all ages. Visit [Klahanie HOA Aquatics](https://www.teamunify.com/SubTabGeneric.jsp?team=cmkhoaa&_stabid_=167646) to learn more about available group swim lessons.

Please call the Klahanie Association office at (425) 463-6388 if you have any questions.
