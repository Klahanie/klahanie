### Covid Private Swim Lesson Guidelines:

During Phase 2 - activities that make six-foot physical distancing difficult (e.g., instructing beginner swimmers) are not authorized
We are only offering swim lessons for children Beginner 2 level and up
To qualify the student must be able to swim the width of the pool (approx. 15 meters) without being helped
Instructors will avoid direct contact with the swimmers
Instructors will be in the water for Beginner level students, and on the deck for Intermediate and Advanced level students. 
Private and Semi-private lessons will only be offered during Open Swim times
Once swimmers are assigned an instructor, times will be scheduled directly with instructor (we appreciate your flexibility with scheduling)
Semi-private lessons will only be available for members of the same household only (i.e. both swimmers must live in the same house)
Swimmers must have similar swimming ability as well
