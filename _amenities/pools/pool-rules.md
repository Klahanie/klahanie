While enjoying the pools, please follow our pool rules and all directions given by lifeguards and staff members. 

#### General Pool Rules

The lifesaving personnel are in complete charge of the pool area. The rules and requests made by lifesaving personnel must always be followed. They have the authority to ask anyone to leave the pool if that person disobeys the safety or general pool rules, or if his/her conduct is detrimental to the common pleasure of other patrons enjoying the pool. The lifesaving personnel reserve the right to close the pool complex, or any portions of the pool complex, for any safety or maintenance reasons. 

All accidents should be reported to the lifesaving personnel immediately. A first aid kit is available in the guard office. In case of emergency, a 9-1-1 phone is located next to the boy’s locker room door facing the pool deck.
