The Klahanie Homeowner's Association (HOA) operates two 25-meter pools, each with four lanes. Lakeside Pool is open all year. Mountainview Pool is open from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day. You can find pool schedules, swim lesson information, and pool rules below.

Klahanie residents enjoy exclusive access to the Klahanie pools and aquatics programs. Please register yourself at the HOA office prior to your first pool visit and plan to show your photo ID each time you check in at the pool. (HOA office hours are Monday - Thursday, 8:30 a.m.–5:00 p.m., and Friday 9 a.m.–4 p.m.)
