<p class="lead">Providing unduplicated levels of neighborhood security</p>
<em>by Sgt. Steve Lysaght</em>

I am a sergeant with the King County Sheriff’s Office and, for the past seven years, it has also been my pleasure to be the director of your Klahanie Neighborhood Patrol (KNP).

Over the years, the KNP program has grown, providing Klahanie with new police-related services as the program evolves. I thought this would be a great time to reintroduce the KNP and give residents an understanding of the enhanced security you receive.

Currently, your KNP is comprised of 23 deputies, detectives, and sergeants, all employees of the King County Sheriff’s Office. All KNP members are working in Klahanie in addition to their regular jobs and have permission to use their patrol vehicles for KNP duties.

Police, Sheriff, or Both?

The City of Sammamish contracts with the Sheriff’s Office to staff the City of Sammamish Police Department. The Sammamish officers are tasked with patrolling the incorporated area of Sammamish, which includes Klahanie. However, Sammamish is a large geographical area with a rapidly growing population. For this reason, your Klahanie Homeowner’s Association created the KNP to provide enhanced police services to the Klahanie community. The KNP have legal powers to ticket, arrest, or apprehend anyone breaking the law.

The KNP is staffed daily by three or more deputies, on staggered shifts, to ensure cost-effective use of the Klahanie public safety budget. Our staff currently includes five sergeants, four detectives, two SWAT team members, and two K9s, each with a depth of training and experience. We drive both marked and unmarked police vehicles and work in uniformed and plainclothes capacities. Our daily patrols are usually staffed in the morning and early afternoon, when burglaries are most likely, as well as late evening and overnight, when vehicle prowls are most common. 

The enhanced services offered by your KNP include foot and bike patrols of the Klahanie trail systems, additional parking and school zone enforcement, and shortened response times to both emergency and nonemergency calls for service. We also work with your HOA staff to address any problems, assist with creating block watches, attend community meetings, provide security for many Klahanie HOA-hosted events, and conduct package theft patrols. Our most popular service is the Vacation Security Check program. Fill out the <a href="https://klahanie.com/files/Vacation-House-Check-2018.pdf">Vacation House Check Form</a> to have deputies check your house daily while you’re away. 

Klahanie residents enjoy police staffing that is unparalleled here in King County. We are proud to be your Klahanie Neighborhood Patrol. Please call upon us if we can be of service.
