Come and join the fun at the annual Klahanie 5K Fun Run and picnic. Prizes will be awarded in the Men's, Women's and Kids (12 and under) categories. Following the run will be a picnic with Subway sandwiches!
<strong>A few important changes this year:</strong>
Registration is REQUIRED if you want a numbered bib. Registration will open in mid-May and go through June 8th. The registration form will be available in Community Communications/eForms/2020 5K and picnic registration.Â  You must have a login to the Klahanie resident site to register. You are still able to participate if you don't pre-register, however, you will not be given a bib number. So if you're in it to win it, pre-register!
Registration will start at 9am and the race will start at 10am.
The waiver form is attached, please try to complete that ahead of time and bring it with you to registration.
