Before you rent your home, it is important that you follow these three steps.

<ol type = "1">
<li>Carefully read the [Rules and Regulations]({{site.url}}/files/Klahanie-Association-Rules-and-Regulations-2018.pdf) (Section 4.11 Rental Properties). If your renter incurs fines from failure to comply with the Klahanie Homeowners Association (KHOA) Rules and Regulations, you, as the home owner, are financially responsible.</li.>
<li>Complete the [Rental Registration Form]({{site.url}}/files/Rental-Letter.pdf) and return the form to the KHOA office. By filling out the Rental Registration Form, you are letting KHOA staff know that you have renters, and you are providing the renters' names and contact information. If you are using a property mangament firm, include their contact information.</li> 
<li>Send a copy of the lease to the KHOA office so your renters are entered in the KHOA records. (Pool passes can be arranged once this step is complete.)</li>
</ol>

Remember to keep your mailing address and contact information up-to-date at the KHOA office, in case your tenant receives a fine or other communication mailed to your address. 

If you do not complete the Rental Registration Form and rent your home without notifying the KHOA, you will receive a $500 fine. Renters living in an unregistered home will not be able to use the Klahanie amenities until the home is registered.
