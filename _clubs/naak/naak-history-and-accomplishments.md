# NAAK History and Accomplishments

### History
A group of like-minded community volunteers formed the Natural Areas Association of Klahanie (NAAK) in 2001. They were interested in

* Protecting and preserving Klahanie’s forests, meadows, wetlands, ponds, streams, lake, and wildlife habitats
* Protecting and preserving Klahanie’s wildlife by promoting coexistence with wildlife and humane stewardship practices
* Enhancing community awareness of Klahanie’s natural areas and participation in their preservation, starting with Yellow Lake

Similar to other major developments in the Pacific Northwest, Klahanie is faced with noxious weeds encroaching upon its natural areas. Noxious weeds are introduced, non-native, and invasive plants that can harm the environment, wildlife habitats, and the economy. These plants spread and outcompete native plants. Scotch broom and English ivy have the potential to cause serious damage. Scotch broom contains highly combustible oils that can be a fire hazard, and English ivy weakens, and can ultimately topple, trees. Because noxious weeds have few competitors, they can dominate Klahanie’s vegetative system, resulting in a mono-species environment. This, in turn, provides less food, shelter, and nesting habitats for wildlife.

NAAK volunteers provide careful and responsible stewardship of Klahanie’s valued and diverse natural areas and the wildlife they support.


### Accomplishments

* Worked in partnership with King County and Puget Sound Energy (PSE) to secure funding and resources to remove noxious weeds and restore critical habitats in Klahanie’s major Native Growth Protection Areas (NGPAs). To date, we have received over $150,000 in environmental grants and free restoration services.
* Partnered with PSE to restore and enhance eight natural area sites. These mitigations included removing noxious weeds, adding hundreds of native plants, and free maintenance and watering for three years until the plants were self-sustaining.  
* Coordinated efforts between King County and Klahanie to ensure mandated noxious weeds were removed, according to strict county requirements. This includes the ongoing removal of Garlic mustard and Purple loosestrife. In addition, volunteer work parties have removed several thousand Tansy ragwort plants, which are highly invasive and can be poisonous to animals.
* Obtained and coordinated the services of, and worked along with, EarthCorps to remove a vast number of destructive noxious weeds, including English ivy, from hundreds of trees.
* Planted a variety of native plants and trees compatible with each unique natural habitat. For example, the Yellow Lake area restoration included adding trees to shade out noxious weeds and replacing older trees as they die.
* Reduced noxious weeds to a small fraction of the overall vegetative coverage in Klahanie’s native growth areas. Through our ongoing stewardship, regrowth is being controlled.
* Sponsored dozens of work parties over the years to remove noxious weeds, such as English ivy, Scotch broom, and Tansy ragwort from natural areas throughout Klahanie. Today, there are fewer major removal projects in Klahanie's natural areas; our current focus is controlling the noxious weeds. The Eagles Scouts participated in several of our work parties that focused on restoring a sensitive area in the Yellow Lake NGPA, which had been destroyed by off-trail biking.
* Developed six family-friendly Klahanie-specific nature brochures, which provide native plant, tree, wildlife, and bird information. The Native Plant Demonstration Garden located across the street from the Klahanie Park was created with the help of an energetic and hard-working Webelos Scout group.
* Gained community certification as an Urban Wildlife Sanctuary by the Humane Society of the United States.
* Hosted a 12-month bird survey in the Gander Pond and Yellow Lake areas. Another 12-month survey was conducted at Queens Bog, with the Eastside Audubon Society. In subsequent years, Christmas Bird Counts have been conducted around Gander Pond and Yellow Lake. This data was shared with our community via the [Klahanie Bird Checklist]({{site.url}}/clubs/naak/Bird-Checklist.pdf), which is available in hardcopy at the KHOA office.
* Obtained two grants, for habitat restoration, from the Kiwanis Club of Issaquah. Received an Environmental Excellence Award, which included a tree that was planted across from the KHOA office.
* Monitored the health of Yellow Lake by gathering annual water samples to test for E. coli forms, petroleum, herbicides, heavy metals, and the overall health of the lake. We are happy to report all tests have indicated the lake is healthy, with the exception of E. coli forms likely due to pet waste. We thank all pet owners who properly dispose of their pet waste.
* Implemented a successful Monofilament Fishing Line Recovery and Recycling program at Yellow Lake. This program was presented to Senator Mark Mullet and several state legislative committees; it has now been implemented at more than 200 locations within our state, including 74 city and county parks and piers, 140 Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) sites, and 29 state parks.
* Installed and annually maintain wood duck nesting boxes at Gander Pond. Wood ducks and hooded mergansers use these nesting boxes during their spring nesting season every year.
* Added a pollinator habitat with interpretive signs to support the dwindling populations of pollinators, such as native bees, hummingbirds, moths, and more.
* Acted in an advisory capacity to KHOA management and board of directors regarding recommended projects, status reports, and budget requests. NAAK’s work continues to be included in the annual budget.


### What's Ongoing?

While significant progress has been made, the presence of noxious weeds continues to pose a threat to the health and diversity of Klahanie’s native ecosystems and wildlife habitats. Our ongoing stewardship keeps noxious weeds from re-establishing and spreading throughout the natural areas.

Wildlife habitats have been dramatically improved because Klahanie’s natural areas now offer an abundant variety of native plants for food, nesting, and protection. The surrounding forests, wetlands, ponds, and Yellow Lake area support more than 100 species of birds, including herons, woodpeckers, raptors, owls, and a large variety of songbirds and waterfowl. The Eastside Audubon Society has documented these sightings in their bird surveys and Christmas Bird Counts. Deer, little brown bats, shrews, coyotes, Douglas squirrels, beavers, possums, the occasional bobcat or Black bear, and several other mammals frequent these areas.

With the support of the Klahanie Board of Directors, homeowners association staff, and volunteers, the beauty of our natural areas and the wildlife that these habitats support can be enjoyed both today and in the future.

If you are interested in joining NAAK and/or participating in a sponsored work party, please contact the [Klahanie Homeowners Association](mailto:info@klahanie.com) to let them know of your interest and availability. A NAAK member will get in touch with you. We look forward to working with you.
