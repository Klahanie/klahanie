If you would like more space to grow plants and work outdoors, pea patch gardening is a wonderful option. Residents who are part of the Klahanie Community Pea Patch have fun working alongside each other, tending their plot, and growing a bountiful crop.

The Klahanie Pea Patch is used recreationally, to grow vegetables and flowers for families and local charities. The patch is down the gravel road behind the Sundance condominiums and is run by volunteers who live in Klahanie. Participation is open to all Klahanie residents. The active growing season is from April 1st through October 31st. A full-size pea patch plot is approximately 10’ x 20’ and rents for $50. A half plot is approximately 10’ x 10’ and rents for $25.
