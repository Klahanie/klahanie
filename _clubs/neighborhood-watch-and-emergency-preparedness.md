**Neighborhood Watch (NW) begins when you and your neighbors. gather in another’s home or connect via a summer BBQ/Block Party and**

* A representative from NW/EP will provide a 3-minute explanation and invite one of you to serve as your NW/EP (She/he will organize the following info into a simple directory for all neighborhood participants).
* You’ll be invited to add your name, phone number, e-mail, address to your e-directory of participating neighbors.
* You’ll receive the above icon to place in a window at the front of your house,
* As a participant, you are choosing to be “another set of eyes” regarding your neighbor’s home/property/well-being.

**Emergency Preparedness (EP) helps Neighborhood Watch (NW) clusters prepare their households for emergencies -- earthquakes, tsunamis, fire, etc.) by**
* Obtaining emergency water/food, blankets, medications, flashlights, etc.
* Being available to assist one another in the neighborhood in time of need because we have names, addresses, phones, e-mails, etc.

**We’d like all of Klahanie’s neighborhood clusters to be active in Neighborhood Watch/Emergency Preparedness.**

Neighborhood Watch/Emergency Preparedness is supported by the Klahanie Board of Directors &amp; your participation increases “neighborliness” which always pays great dividends.
