### Neighborhood Watch and Emergency Preparedness

**Neighborhood Watch (NW) begins when you and your neighbors. **

If you are interested in starting a neighborhoow watch program in your area, host a block party and:
* A representative from NW/EP will provide a 3-minute explanation and invite one of you to serve as your NW/EP
* You’ll be invited to add your name, phone number, e-mail, address to your e-directory of participating neighbors
* You’ll receive a neighborhood watch decal to place in a window at the front of your house
* As a participant, you are choosing to be “another set of eyes” regarding your neighbor’s home/property/well-being

**Emergency Preparedness (EP) helps Neighborhood Watch (NW) clusters prepare their households for emergencies -- earthquakes, tsunamis, fire, etc.) by**
* Obtaining emergency water/food, blankets, medications, flashlights, etc.
* Being available to assist one another in the neighborhood in time of need because we have names, addresses, phones, e-mails, etc.

**We’d like all of Klahanie’s neighborhood clusters to be active in Neighborhood Watch/Emergency Preparedness.**

Neighborhood Watch/Emergency Preparedness is supported by the Klahanie Board of Directors, and your participation increases “neighborliness” which always pays great dividends.
