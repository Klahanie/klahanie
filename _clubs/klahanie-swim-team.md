The Klahanie Swim Team (KST) began, at Klahanie’s Mountainview Pool, in 1987 with 11 swimmers.  They have operated each spring and summer since then, with more than 6,000 Klahanie swimmers participating. Stop by the Mountainview Pool office to see team photos from more than three decades and experience a little KST history.

The Klahanie Swim Team is a member of the 26-team Midlakes Swim League and provides a competitive swimming environment for 200 young Klahanie swimmers, ages 5–18, from May through July each year. The team is open to Klahanie residents only and is a terrific way to meet your neighbors, serve your community, and have your children improve their swim skills in a recreationally competitive environment. KST hosts seven home swim meets at the Mountainview Pool during the summer, and our swimmers travel to other local league pools to compete each week. Residents and visiting teams can purchase dinner and snacks at The Shark Café during each home meet. 

The KST meets are held at Klahanie's Mountainview Pool - 4280 Klahanie Drive SE, Issaquah, WA 98029.
The Klahanie Swim Team mailing address is 4580 Klahanie Dr SE #172, Issaquah, WA 98029.

The team is managed by a volunteer board of directors and a working committee that oversees team operations. Each swimmer's family must volunteer 10–12 hours during every season to support the team.
