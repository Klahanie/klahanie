NAAK is a volunteer group of Klahanie residents committed to keeping Klahanie's natural areas healthy and providing a diverse habitat that protects and preserves wildlife.

### What's Happening Now

The Native Plant Demonstration Garden, across from Klahanie Park, is undergoing rejuvenation. Natural Areas Association of Klahanie (NAAK) volunteers added plant labels and pruned selectively to provide improved definition between the plants. Spring and summer are excellent times to visit the garden and enjoy the plant varieties and blooms.

Many projects are underway to control noxious weeds in our natural areas. Noxious weeds can decrease the biodiversity of native ecosystems, reduce water quality, and threaten wildlife habitats. These plants tend to reproduce quickly, lack predators, and are difficult to control without a dedicated and ongoing commitment of stewardship.

A Native Plant Pollinator Habitat was created behind the Native Plant Demonstration Garden. These beautiful native plants provide nectar for pollinators, including hummingbirds, native bees, butterflies, and moths.

If you are curious about what NAAK / EarthCorps will be doing around your neighborhood or favorite hiking trails this spring, summer, and fall, please check out the [NAAK / EarthCorps Projects page]({{site.url}}/clubs/naak/naak-earthcorps-projects-for-2019.html).

If you are interested in joining NAAK, or even willing to pitch in for a few hours, please contact the [Klahanie Homeowners Association](mailto:info@klahanie.com) to let them know of your interest and availability. A NAAK member will get in touch with you.

### NAAK Mission

NAAK functions in a stewardship capacity for Klahanie’s natural areas - a major portion of Klahanie's 300 acres of open space. The vast majority of these areas are designated Native Growth Protection Areas, which means that no native growth can be removed or disturbed, and no structures can be built.

NAAK works closely with the Klahanie Association Director, recommending projects and activities to support

* Removing and controling noxious weeds in Klahanie’s natural areas
* Restoring native plant and wildlife habitats
* Overseeing the health of Yellow Lake and its aquatic life
* Educating our community about native plants, noxious weeds, and the wildlife that frequent the Klahanie area

NAAK also provides direction to contracted services, like EarthCorps, who assist in the restoration and maintenance of our natural spaces. From March through October, NAAK hosts and conducts periodic Klahanie volunteer work parties to remove noxious weeds and restore habitats. 

We invite you to join us in maintaining our healthy and beautiful natural areas.
