<h3 style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;">Eleven years ago, my wife and I chose to move to Klahanie because the community represented what we both felt was an ideal setting to raise our family. Now our children are 8 and 10, and we still feel the same way about this community. Currently, I am on the Communication Committee and the Building &amp; Special Projects Committee for Klahanie.</h3>
