The main way most Klahanie residents interact with the administration staff is dealing with financial or compliance concerns. These encompass assessments payments, fines or other services fees included in your quarterly assessment billing.

### Assessments
Currently the annual assessments are $800 a year and most residents elect to pay them quarterly.
