A part of the benefit of living in an HOA is the ability to be personally involved in the association planning and guidance. This is done through finding an avenue where you want to volunteer your time and expertise to help on one of the active committees.

The list below will describe the committee options so that you can select where and how you want to contribute to the management of the community. Our Governing documents set forth just two mandatory, or standing committees, Architectural Controls and Fine. All the others are set up to enhance the quality of life for all residents.

Each committee has a different purpose, and all have at least one Board member and a staff support member. Prior to a meeting, you will receive an agenda from the staff liaison. Most meetings last an hour.

### Standing Committees

**Architectural Control Committee or ACC** generally meets monthly when there are applications for projects dealing with homes and yards that require consideration and review. The task is to discern the acceptable projects from those that may challenge community norms and standards.

**Fines Committee** meets monthly when residents have not responded to the notice from the Compliance department to do something or to cease doing something. It could be as simple as requiring that their lawns be mowed, or that they remove a newly planted vegetable garden in their front yard. When a notice is mailed and no response is received, the resident is invited to the Fine Committee to explain their action or inaction. The committee members decide if a fine is an appropriate way to get the homeowner to abide by the community standards.

### Other Committees

**Building and Special Projects Committee**, deals mainly with the amenities in Klahanie, from sport courts to trails and playgrounds. What do we need more of? Should the playgrounds be updated? Do we have enough benches and are they in the right places? These committee members can have a big impact on how we all can enjoy the community year-around.
**Communications Committee**, works on ways we can communicate the positive messages of what is available here in Klahanie to residents to how we can make this an attractive place for new families to move into.
**Redevelopment Committee**, is the newest committee to be launched. This group will create the plans for the future modification and construction of the Klahanie buildings, pools and amenities. How will Klahanie look and what services will be offered over the next five to 25 years?
**Social (Events) Committee**, works with the staff events planner to make sure that the planned events each year- 5K race, movie nights, parades and cultural events can each be enjoyed by a wide range of residents. Members of the committee help in bringing forward new ideas and to improve the existing events.

## Ad-Hoc Committees

Ad-hoc committees are those that exist for a limited and defined period of time, such as
**The Budget Committee**, works with staff and the Board Treasurer to help craft the annual budget that, once approved becomes the operating budget for the coming year. This committee begins in early summer and is over before the Budget Ratification meeting in November.
**The Nominating Committee**, helps to run the fall Board of Directors election campaign. The members work to insure that the elections are fair to all candidates and that the community is well informed about the platform of the candidates.

## What is the process from here?
Send an email to <a href="mailto:communitymanager@klahanie.com">the Community Manager</a> and let us know of your interest in joining a Committee. One of the staff will contact you to let you know which committees have openings and to invite you to attend as a guest to assess your interest in that committee. After the meeting, we encourage you to meet with the committee chair. At that time it should be clear if this is a good fit for you. Each new prospective member of any committee is proposed to the Board and accepted to the committee.
Thank you for helping to ensure that Klahanie continues to be the most desirable place to live in Sammamish.
