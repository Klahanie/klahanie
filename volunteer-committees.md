Living in a homeowners association means that you can be personally involved with association planning and events. Meet your neighbors and take an active role in shaping Klahanie's future by volunteering your time and expertise on one of the committees.

Our governing documents established two standing committees, the Architectural Controls Committee (ACC) and the Fine Committee. The others committees exist to enhance the quality of life in our Klahanie community. At least one board member and a staff support member participate in each committee.

### Standing Committees

**Architectural Control Committee.** The ACC typically meets monthly, to review applications for home and yard projects. They approve the acceptable projects and guide those residents whose projects challenge community norms and standards.

**Fines Committee.** When necessary, the Fines Committee committee meets monthly to help residents who have not responded to their notice from the Compliance Director. Residents are invited to the Fine Committee meetings to explain their situation, and committee members decide if a fine is an appropriate incentive to follow community standards in each individual circumstance.

### Other Committees

**Building and Special Projects Committee.** This committee primarily concerns itself with the maintenance and improvement of our outdoor amenities in Klahanie, such as sport courts, trails, and playgrounds. These committee members can have a significant impact on year-round recreation in our community.

**Communications Committee.** The Communications Committee helps the homeowners association office staff create positive and clear messaging to Klahanie residents. They want residents to be informed and involved, and they want to inspire prospective families to make Klahanie their home.

**Redevelopment Committee.** This forward-thinking group is Klahanie's newest committee. Looking five to 25 years into the future, these individuals will plan for the upcoming modification and construction of Klahanie buildings, pools, and amenities.

**Events Committee.** The Events Committee works with the homeowners association staff events planner to make sure that traditional Klahanie events, such as the 5K race, movie nights, parades, and cultural events are accessible and enjoyable for a wide range of residents. Committee members often propose new ideas and suggestions for improving existing events.

### Ad hoc Committees

Ad hoc committees exist for a limited and defined period of time.

**The Budget Committee.** The Budget Committee works with homeowners association staff and the board treasurer to help craft the annual budget for the coming year. This committee begins meeting in early summer and finishes by November.

**The Nominating Committee.** These individuals help run the fall Board of Directors election campaign. Nominating Committee members work to insure that the elections are fair and that our Klahanie community is well informed about the candidates' platforms.

## How do I join a Klahanie committee?
If you are interested joining a Klahanie committee, please email the <a href="mailto:communitymanager@klahanie.com">Community Manager</a>. One of the homeowners association staff will let you know what committee or committees have openings and invite you to attend one or more meetings, as a guest, to assess your interest in the committees. After you attend a meeting, we encourage you to talk with the committee chairperson to determine if the committee is a good fit. Each new prospective committee member is proposed to the board for acceptance into the committee.
