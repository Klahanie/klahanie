Haley Davies joined our team in September of 2018 as our Front Office Manager. She is an Issaquah native, living in the area for 20+ years. She came to us with an extensive background in Property Management, where she previously managed multiple apartments complexes in Seattle WA. Her true passion though is working with horses. She has ridden and shown horses her entire life and spends any free time she has in the barn!
