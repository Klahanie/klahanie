Keith joined our team in November of 2020 and has dove right in! Every pun intended!

Keith comes to us from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. He has his degree in Hospitality Management and has an extensive background that has prepared him to be our Director of Sports and Recreation.

He has had the privilege to have been employed as the General Manager of several restaurants, Regional Manager for 6 Anytime Fitness locations, the Head Coach for a high school and YMCA swim teams, the Program Director at the Mary Wayte Pool, and the Aquatics Director at the YMCA of Greater Seattle. He was also the owner and operator of a photography studio for 13 years.

He has a passion for sports, helping those in his community, and coaching kids to realize thier potential. He spent over twenty years volunteering with the American Red Cross on both the local and state level. He volunteered for over ten years for Special Olympics coaching swimming. He believes having positive outlets for children helps them develop into our future leaders.

In his free time, Keith is often in The Dog House. That is the name of his boat. He also likes to hike, bike, swim and collect wine. He has a cute rescue cat named Callie. Keith is getting married to his fiance, Kara, in March of 2021.
