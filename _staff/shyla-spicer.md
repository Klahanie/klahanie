Shyla joined our team in August 2020 and is getting up and running with our staff, board, and community.

She has a background in Operations, Project Management, and Global Brand Marketing from Nike, Inc in Beaverton, Oregon. She spent over 12 years managing large projects and initiatives for North America Supply Chain, Global Treasury, Sustainable Innovation, Sportswear, and Menâ€™s Training.

Her experience has also allowed for her to serve as the CEO/Founder of the Portland All Nations Canoe Family, a community led nonprofit which provided programs and activities to underserved Native American communities in the City of Portland which provided access to resources, cultural identity, suicide prevention, water safety, and mentorship to at risk youth.

Most recently she is the former Executive Director for the Suquamish Tribe, where she managed a community of over 4000 residents, a Tribal Government with 23 departments and over 500 employees. Shyla implemented and enhanced Government operations, defined and set strategic direction, and led large capital projects which included public parks, a health clinic, and implemented an affordable housing act.

Shyla has a BS in Business, with a focus in Supply & Logistics Management from Portland State University and an MBA in Strategy and Entrepreneurship from the University of Portland.

On her off days, she spends time on the water paddle boarding, kayaking, and hiking with her husband Chukwudi, 13-year-old son Cyrus, and their Australian cattle dog Kenna. She is an enrolled member of the Confederated Tribes of the Yakama Nation and spends time on boards relating to the Arts and Education. Fun fact about Shyla, she worked as a certified lifeguard and swim instructor during her undergrad and still enjoys swimming and surfing anytime she can.
