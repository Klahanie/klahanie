Good morning all - we are still seeing air quality tracking at 167. Our goal is to open within range 100 -150. Although we see improvements, it's still not within our range. The pool will remain closed for today. We are committed to give you updated announcements on this issue daily.

You can track along with us [here](https://www.purpleair.com/map?opt=1/mAQI/a10/cC0#11/47.5707/-122.0073).

Contact the Main Office directly should you have any further questions or concerns at [425-392-4663](tel:425-392-4663) or [info@klahanie.com](mailto:info@klahanie.com).

Have a great day Klahanie! Stay safe and look out for one another.
