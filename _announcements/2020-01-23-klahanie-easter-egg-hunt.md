UNFORTUNATELY, THE ANNUAL KLAHANIE EASTER EGG HUNT WILL HAVE TO BE CANCELED BASED ON GATHERING BANS.Â  IT WILL NOT BE RESCHEDULED THIS YEAR.

The annual Klahanie Easter Egg Hunt is back! At Mountainview Park from 9:30-11AM. There will be three age groups: 7 and up at 9:45, ages 3-6 at 10AM and ages 2 and under at 10:15. Be sure to bring your baskets for eggs and it is usually wet on the grass so wear appropriate footwear.
