We are excited to announce that the Lakeside and Mountain view pools will be open as of Wednesday, July 1st. In an effort to maintain safety and health for all of our residents we will be implementing  COVID-19 general guidelines.

General COVID-19 Guidelines

* Swimming sessions will be 1.5 hours of Open Swim time with 30 minutes of cleaning in between the hours of 11am-9pm – please reference pool specific schedule on Klahanie website.
* Patrons will be asked to leave the facility entirely during this 30 minute cleaning period (to include locker rooms).
* Initially we will be limited to 15 Patrons in each facility per session – offered on a first come, first serve basis.
* Locker Rooms are available for restroom use only - showers and changing areas are not available at this time.
* Patrons must wear a mask while engaging with lifeguards and patrons outside their immediate family, during check in, and while inside the locker rooms.
* Only Klahanie residents will be allowed to use pools during this phase, no paid guests will be permitted at this time.
* Facilities will provide chairs that are appropriate spaced, and will be sanitized during every cleaning session. Please keep chairs in designated areas as found.
