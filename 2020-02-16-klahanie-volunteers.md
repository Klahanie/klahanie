<strong><a>We all know Klahanie is a great place to live.  Part of the reason is because of all the fun community events your HOA assessments help fund.  Events are growing every year, and we want to do more of them!  However, we cannot sustain and grow these events without volunteers.  Below are 5 reasons to volunteer.</a></strong>
