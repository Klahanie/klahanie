<h3><strong>Background: </strong></h3>
<h3>A group of like-minded community volunteers formed the Natural Areas Association of Klahanie (NAAK) in 2001.  Their shared interests were to:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3>Protect and preserve Klahanie’s forests, meadows, wetlands, lake, ponds, streams and wildlife habitats</h3>
</li>
 	<li>
<h3>Protect and preserve Klahanie’s wildlife by promoting coexistence with wildlife and humane stewardship practices</h3>
</li>
 	<li>
<h3>Enhance community awareness of Klahanie’s natural areas and participation in their preservation, starting with Yellow Lake.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>As with many major developments in the Pacific Northwest, Klahanie is faced with noxious weeds encroaching upon its natural areas.  Noxious weeds are an introduced non-native invasive species of plants that can harm the environment, wildlife habitats and the economy.  These plants spread and outcompete native plants.  For example, Scotch broom and English ivy have the potential to cause serious damage.  Scotch broom contains highly combustible oils that can make it a fire hazard and English ivy weakens and can ultimately topple trees.</h3>
<h3>Because noxious weeds have few competitors, they can dominate Klahanie's vegetative system, resulting in a "mono-species" habitat.  This, in turn, provides less food, shelter and nesting habitats for wildlife.</h3>
<h3>NAAK volunteers provide careful and responsible stewardship of Klahanie’s valued and diverse natural areas and the wildlife they support.</h3>
<h3><strong>Accomplishments: </strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3>Worked in partnership with King County and Puget Sound Energy to secure funding and resources to remove noxious weeds and restore critical habitats in Klahanie's major Native Growth Protection Areas (NGPAs). To date, this has resulted in over $100,000 in environmental grants and free restoration services.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3>Partnered with Puget Sound Energy (PSE) to restore and enhance six NGPA sites. These mitigations included removal of noxious weeds, the addition of hundreds of native plants and free maintenance and watering for three years until the plants become self-sustaining.  A portion of the Mountain View natural area was completed in January, 2018.  Scotch broom and Himalayan blackberries were removed and 127 native plants were added, including Pacific crabapples, Red-flowering currants, Snowberries and Nootka roses.  In 2019, we look forward to partnering with Bonneville Power Administration (who has assumed responsibility for the maintenance of the power line corridor from PSE) in pursuing additional environmental mitigation opportunities.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3>Coordinated efforts between King County and Klahanie to ensure mandated noxious weeds were removed, according to strict County requirements. This includes the ongoing removal of Garlic mustard and Purple loosestrife.  In addition, volunteer work parties have removed several thousand Tansy ragwort plants, which is highly invasive and can be poisonous to animals.</h3>
</li>
 	<li>
<h3>Obtained and coordinated the services of, and worked along with, EarthCorps to remove a vast number of noxious weeds, including the removal of destructive English ivy from hundreds of trees.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>A variety of native plants and trees compatible with each unique natural habitat have been planted.  One example: The Yellow Lake area restoration included adding trees to "shade out" noxious weeds and replace older trees as they die.</h3>
<h3>Our ongoing collaboration has reduced noxious weeds to a small fraction of the overall vegetative coverage in Klahanie’s native growth areas.  And, through ongoing stewardship, re-growth is being controlled.</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3>Sponsored dozens of work parties throughout the years to remove noxious weeds, such as English ivy, Scotch broom, and Tansy ragwort from natural areas throughout Klahanie. The progress in removing and controlling these weeds continues.  Today, Klahanie’s natural areas are in a state of stewardship where major removal efforts have been drastically reduced and the focus is now on control measures.  In addition, several work parties included the participation of the Eagle Scouts.  These work parties focused on restoring a sensitive area in the Yellow Lake NGPA that had been destroyed by off trail biking.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3>Developed six family-friendly Klahanie-specific nature brochures in 2008 to provide native plant, tree, wildlife and bird information. The Native Plant Demonstration Garden located across the street from the Klahanie Park was created in 2010 with the help of an energetic and hard-working Webelos Scout group.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3>Gained community certification as an Urban Wildlife Sanctuary by the Humane Society of the United States in 2009.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3>Hosted a 12-month bird survey in 2007 at the Gander Pond and Yellow Lake areas. In 2008 another 12-month survey was conducted at Queens Bog with the Eastside Audubon Society.  In subsequent years, Christmas Bird Counts have been conducted around Gander Pond and Yellow Lake. This data was shared with our community via the Klahanie bird checklist, which is available as a link or hardcopy at the HOA office.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3>Obtained two grants from the Issaquah Kiwanis club in 2008 for habitat restoration. Received an Environmental Achievement award in 2009 and a tree that was planted across from the HOA office.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3>Monitored the health of Yellow Lake by gathering water samples annually for the testing of e-coli forms, petroleum, herbicides, heavy metals and the overall health of the lake. We are happy to report all tests to-date have indicated the lake is healthy with exception of e-coli forms likely due to pet waste.   We thank all pet owners who diligently dispose of their pet waste.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3>Implemented a successful Monofilament Fishing Line Recovery and Recycling program at Yellow Lake in 2013. This program was then presented to Senator Mark Mullet and several state legislative committees.  It has now been implemented at over 200 locations within our state, including 74 city and county parks and piers, 137 Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) sites and 29 state parks.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3>Installed and annually maintain Wood Duck nesting boxes at Gander Pond. Wood Ducks and Hooded Mergansers use these nesting boxes during their spring nesting season every year.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3>Acted in an advisory capacity to Klahanie HOA management and Board of Directors. This currently includes recommended projects, status reports, and budget requests.  NAAK's work continues to be included in the annual budget.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What's Ongoing?</strong></h3>
<h3>While significant progress has been made, the presence of noxious weeds continues to pose a threat to the health and diversity of Klahanie’s native ecosystems and wildlife habitats.  Our ongoing stewardship keeps noxious weeds from re-establishing and spreading throughout the natural areas.</h3>
<h3>Wildlife habitats have been dramatically improved because Klahanie’s natural areas now offer an abundant variety of native plants for food, nesting and protection.  The surrounding forests, wetlands, ponds and Yellow Lake support more than 100 species of birds, including: herons, woodpeckers, raptors, owls and a large variety of songbirds and waterfowl. These sightings have been documented by the Eastside Audubon Society in their Bird Surveys and Christmas Bird Counts.</h3>
<h3>In addition, deer, little brown bats, shrews, coyotes, Douglas squirrels, beavers, possums, the occasional bobcat or Black bear and several other mammals frequent these areas.</h3>
<h3>With the support of the Klahanie HOA Board of Directors, staff, and volunteers, the beauty of our natural areas and the wildlife that these habitats support can be enjoyed both today and in the future.</h3>
<h3>Join our NAAK team and/or help by participating in sponsored work parties.  We will enjoy working with you.</h3>
