<p>Located on a forested plateau 18 miles east of Seattle, the 900-acre Klahanie neighborhood contains 1,967 single family homes, 718 condominium units, and 405 apartment units. Our residents are surrounded by nature and recreation areas in every direction, including 30 miles of groomed trails, a scenic alpine lake, two swimming pools, three tennis and four basketball courts, four pickleball/badminton courts, and baseball fields.</p>

<p>Originally launched in 1984, Klahanie grew in stages over the following decade. Involving several established home builders during each stage ensured that our community had a variety of home designs, sizes, and features that have continued to be very attractive to families.</p>

<p>The Klahanie community is well situated. We are near several major employers, yet the Cascade Mountains are only a 40-minute drive east. The Costco world headquarters are four miles away. Microsoft, Boeing, Amazon, and Starbucks are all within 20 miles.</p>

<p>Over the years, Klahanie has become a comfortable and safe place to live and raise a family. We are thrilled to welcome international residents who work  for the large corporations in our area, as well as families who have made the Pacific Northwest their home for generations. Our wonderfully diverse population gives residents a unique sense of community where we are likely to find kindred spirits from all over the world.</p>

<p>Other ammenities abound! The renowned Swedish Medical Center and hospital is only five minutes away, and we are fortunate to have shopping, restaurants, movies theaters, and Lake Sammamish State Park all within an easy drive.</p>
