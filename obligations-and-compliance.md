The Klahanie Homeowners Association (KHOA) is a nonprofit organization that exists to benefit its members, help residents follow the covenants, and ensure that common areas are well maintained. By legal contract, every homeowner is a member of the KHOA.

All members have agreed to pay an annual assessment, which covers maintenance of the Klahanie community and KHOA staff salaries. The current annual dues are $800 per year and should be paid in $200 quarterly installments by the first of January, April, July, and October. If you live in a condo development, you have additional dues that are paid to your condo HOA to cover maintenance of your building and grounds.

#### Which areas are common areas and what area belong to the City of Sammamish? 

The KHOA covers all 900 acres in Klahanie, except the streets, sidewalks, and Klahanie Park, which are owned by the City of Sammamish.

#### What is my responsibility?

As a single-family home owner, you own your individual home and the lot it sits on, and you are responsible to maintain both the home and yard in accordance with the guidelines set by the KHOA. The homes in a well-maintained neighborhood will increase in value more quickly than a home in a neighborhood with poorly maintained homes and unkempt yards.

The KHOA Compliance Department works with homeowners to help them understand and follow the covenants. Our [Architectural Controls]({{site.url}}/files/Klahanie-Association-Architectural-Controls-2018.pdf) list the rules for all exterior home improvement projects.

#### How do I make changes to my home or yard?

At some point, you may want to make changes in or around your homeâ€”paint your home a different color, repair the fence, add a deck or shed in the backyard, etc. Before you start the work, please complete an [Architectural Controls Application]({{site.url}}/files/Klahanie-Association-Architectural-Controls-2018.pdf) online or fill out a paper copy that you pick up from the KHOA Office. This is the first step in gaining approval for your exterior modifications. Your application will either be approved by the Compliance Director or referred to the Architectural Control Committee (ACC) for approval or denial. (You are always welcome to attend the ACC meetings). When your project is finished, submit a digital photo of the completed work, along with The Completion Form, to <a href="mailto:Michael.shane@klahanie.com">Klahanie's Compliance Director</a>.

#### What happens if I make changes to my home without ACC approval?

In this instance, you will receive both a $200 fine and a stop-work order. Then, if the project does not fall within the boundaries of the covenants, you will be required to redo the project to meet Klahanie standards.

#### What should I do if I receive a letter from the KHOA compliance staff asking for my attention to something pertaining to my home or yard?

The letter is a notice from the Compliance Director that refers to issues with your home or property that need your attention. This first notice is a friendly reminder to complete the task(s) by a given date. When you have taken care of the issue, send a digital photo as proof that the work is complete, and the matter is solved. If you do not follow the steps above, you will be invited to attend the monthly meeting of the Fine Committee.

Most noncompliance issues arise from problems with yard maintenance. Please note, if there are ongoing yard maintenance issues at the same address, the Fines Committee now has the option to require the owners to contract with a professional landscaping firm for 12 months.
