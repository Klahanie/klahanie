The Klahanie Homeowners Association (KHOA) is a nonprofit organization that exists to make certain the covenants are kept and the common areas are well-maintained. Every homeowner is a member of the KHOA, this relationship is clearly spelled out in the papers you signed and received when you purchased your home. These documents create a legal contract between you and the KHOA.

All members have agreed to pay an annual assessment to cover the maintenance and upkeep of all the facilities and the staff to manage the KHOA activities. The current assessment is $800 a year and can be paid quarterly at $200.

If you live in a home you are only under the guidance of the KHOA, however, if you live in a condo development, you will have an additional fee paid to your condo HOA to cover maintenance of your building and grounds as well as the KHOA to cover all the common areas and amenities.

#### What are common areas and what belongs to the City of Sammamish? 

The KHOA covers all 900 acres in Klahanie, except the streets, sidewalks and Klahanie Park that are owned by the City of Sammamish.

As a single-family home owner, you own your individual home and the lot it sits on and you are responsible to maintain both the home and yard in accordance with the guidelines set by the KHOA. Why is this done? The homes in a well maintained neighborhood will increase in value more quickly than a home in a neighborhood with poorly maintained homes and unkempt yards.

#### Compliance- Architectural Controls

The KHOA has a special section known as the Compliance Department that works with homeowners to help them understand the structure and responsibilities of living in cooperation with the established covenants that apply to all homes in Klahanie. Our [Architectural Controls]({{site.url}}/files/Klahanie-Association-Architectural-Controls-2018.pdf) set out the rules for all exterior home improvement projects.

#### The process to make changes to your home or yard.

At some point you may want to make changes in your home—paint a different color, repair the fence, add a deck or shed in the backyard, etc. Before you start the work PLEASE do yourself a favor and complete an [Architectural Controls Application]({{site.url}}/files/374142017Architectural-Controls_application.pdf), or picked up a paper copy in the Association Office. This is the first step in gaining approval of the work you want to have done. The application will either be approved in the office by the Compliance Director, or referred to the ACC committee (consisting of a group of fellow homeowners) for approval or denial—you can always attend the meeting. Once approved and your work is completed, submit a digital photo of the completed work with The Completion Form and the process is completed.

#### What happens when changes to your home are done without ACC approval?

Basically, you are on risky grounds. As an example, let’s say that you love a brilliant blue color and decide to have your home painted this bright color. You may love it but your neighbors may not. As soon as it is discovered that the work was done without a permit, you will receive both a $200 fine and a Stop Work order. It gets worse when the Baby Blue is not an approved color. What is likely to happen is that you will be required to repaint your home using one of the many approved home colors. Now you have had to paint the home twice and double your painting budget, received a $200 fine when it would have been so easy and cheap to get approval before you started.

#### What happens if you receive a letter from the Compliance staff asking for your attention to something pertaining to your home or yard?

The letter is a notice from the Compliance Director and can pertain to a variety of things that need you attention, such as lawns that need mowing, weeds that need pulling or trash that needs to be removed. This first notice is a friendly reminder to complete the task by a given date. You can solve this by doing the required task and sending back a digital photo as proof that the violation has been removed. As soon as you do this simple step, the violation is removed and nothing further is required from you.

If you ignore this first notice, or you don’t send in the photo showing that the work was completed, you will be invited to attend the monthly meeting of the Fine Committee. Now the consequences to you become quite serious! At this point you are likely to receive a $100 fine, plus a $20 fee per day until the work has been completed. There is NO limitation to the number of days that the $20 can be accessed.

All of these progressive steps are taken to protect the majority of the homeowners from the few who need additional encouragement to live up to their obligations to maintain their homes and yards. Don’t be one of those people!
