All Klahanie property owners are members of the Klahanie Homeowners Association (KHOA). They are part of a major US trend - 25–27% of the US population now live in an HOA. The KHOA is managed by a board of directors, who are elected from among the residents. The board hires the Association Director to manage the daily activities. The director has a team of six full-time employees and one part time employee. Together, the staff oversees the maintenance of the common areas, manages the two swimming pools and lessons, plans community events, helps residents follow the architectural controls, verifies that bills are assessed and paid on time, and supports residents when they come to the office. The KHOA office is located at 4210 244th Place SE, adjacent to the Lakeside Swimming Pool.

### Governing Documents

Every HOA has a series of legal documents that define the rights and obligations of both the association and its owners/residents. These documents establish how the association will be governed and funded; they  describe the association rules and standards. When considering the purchase of a home in any HOA, it is important that you understand the governing documents.

As with most legal documents, there is a general hierarchy of governing documents. The federal laws are at the top of all documents, followed by the state and local regulations. The higher a documents' place in the hierarchy, the greater its legal weight in a court of law. Each HOA has their own set of governing documents and hierarchy.

#### Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&amp;Rs)

The most important and permanent KHOA document is the <a href="http://klahanie.com/coventants-conditions-restrictions/">Covenants, Conditions, &amp; Restrictions (CC&amp;Rs)</a>. The CC&Rs are tied to each property and define the owner's rights and limitations. A positive vote of two-thirds of Klahanie's 3,090 housing units is required to make a change in the CC&amp;R terms.

The CC&amp;Rs
* Define the portions of the development owned by the individual owners and those owned by the association
* Create interlocking relationships between all owners and to the association, for the purposes of maintaining, governing, and funding the development
* Establish standards, restrictions, and obligations in areas ranging from architectural control to prohibitions on various activities, in order to promote harmonious living
* Create the administrative framework for the operation and management of the community association, with many of the specific administrative details spelled out in the bylaws
* Provide a mechanism for the association's financial support via assessments
* Provide for a transition of association control, from the developer to the owners

#### Articles of Incorporation

Klahanie is a legal not-for-profit corporation. The <a href="http://klahanie.com/certificate-of-incorporation/">Articles of Incorporation</a> provide the terms for our nonprofit status. Our nonprofit status

* Limits the liability of individual owners, for association actions
* Entitles the association to the rights granted to all corporations under state law, which is useful for obtaining insurance or bringing suit against another party
* Makes it easier to deal with other parties, such as utilities or vendors
* Grants the board of directors the same rights as all board members of incorporated entities under state statutes

#### Bylaws
The Association <a href="http://klahanie.com/klahanie-bylaws/" >Bylaws</a> address topics such as

* Association membership requirements
* Membership meeting requirements
* Owners' voting rights
* Procedures for electing the board of directors
* Procedures for the board to elect officers
* General powers and duties of the board

#### Rules and Regulations

Klahanie <a href="http://klahanie.com/klahanie-community-rules-regulations/">Rules and Regulations</a> are approved by the board of directors in order to maintain and enhance Klahanie’s property values, attractiveness, and desirability. The Rules and Regulations also define the process of dealing with rule-based complaints. They can be revised as conditions change. 

#### Architectural Controls

A staff of community volunteers form the mandatory Architectural Control Committee (ACC). The ACC has the authority to enforce the <a href="http://klahanie.com/architectural-controls/">Architectural Controls</a>. Most sections in the Architectural Controls relate to members' homes and yards. In accordance with the Architectural Controls and to enforce consistent standards, owners may be required to submit a permit before any modifications take place.
